Frost and sun; it's a wonderful day!
You're still napping, my lovely friend. —
It's time, beauty, wake up:
Open your eyes closed
Towards the Northern Aurora,
Be the star of the north!
Vechor, do you remember, the blizzard was angry,
There was a mist in the murky sky;
The moon is like a pale spot,
Through the gloomy clouds it turned yellow,
And you were sad. —
And now... look out the window:
Under the blue skies
Magnificent carpets,
Glistening in the sun, the snow lies;
The transparent forest is turning black alone,
And the fir tree turns green through the frost,
And the river glitters under the ice.
The whole room has an amber sheen
Illuminated. With a cheerful crackle
A flooded oven is cracking.
It's nice to think by the couch.
But you know, why don't you tell me to go sledding
Do you want a brown filly?
Gliding through the morning snow,
Dear friend, let's run
An impatient horse
And we'll visit the empty fields,
the forests, recently so dense.,
And the shore, dear to me.
